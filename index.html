		<p class="body">The beet is the most intense of vegetables. The
		radish, admittedly, is more feverish, but the fire of
		the radish is a cold fire, the fire of discontent not of
		passion. Tomatoes are lusty enough, yet there runs
		through tomatoes an undercurrent of frivolity.
		Beets are deadly serious.</p>
